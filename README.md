# Image-Decompression-project

This is my first project at ML: SVD-based Principal Component Analysis and Image Decomposition
I learnt this from reading Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow. O'Reilly Media. Although we already know that PCA makes ML modelling faster, I wanted to know the exact effect of PCA as the number of dimensions decreases.

The following is the [presentation slides](./LinAlg_project.pdf) and this is the [research report](./2015_math_capstone.pdf).
